'''This script will call Google Maps to calculate the time to walk between every combination of bus stops and the time to drive between every combination of bus stops. We can't do this live in the app because of rate limiting and because Google requires you show a map, which I don't want to do. '''

#We'll have to go through each of the 17 stops with one origin and all 16 other stops as destinations. So we'll end up with fitten.json, mcm8th.json, etc. Then we can access the json for the specific starting point, find the destination, and get the travel time. Rate limiting prevents doing this in a more elegant way with fewer API calls.
